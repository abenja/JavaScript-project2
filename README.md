Antony Benjamin: A simple school project application that retrieves artist information using last.fm API. The user can search for an artist, and is given the bio and top albums.
Main features include AJAX, error handling, DOM manipulation. Based on the evaluation criteria, I feel that I should get full points for my work. I have understood every line of code I wrote, and I've managed to do everything that was required.

All files have been validated.
